## Project Information (Contributors)

If you are a contributor (which there isn't any right now but I'm staying ahead of things), here is 
some useful information that you will find about this project below:

## Frontend (Next.js, Tailwind CSS)

The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The main reason I stuck with Next.js is because
it is just easier to work with the headless commerce products that I am deciding on. This may be 
changed someday because I am not necessarily the biggest fan of Next.js, but it's what we're stuck 
with for now.

### Frontend To Do/Checklist

- [ ] Setup unit testing for this project
- [ ] Setup automated testing
- [ ] Set up SEO 
- [ ] `tailwind.config.ts` file 
- [ ] 

## WeisMind Creative Family

WeisGear is a part of the WeisMind Creative family of brands that I have created. WeisMind is my 
personal brand that I have used since 2016 in various projects and businesses, like WeisMind Consulting 
and the WeisMind Podcast. I am renewing my efforts at bringing my brand back to life by launching the
WeisMind Weekly Newsletter and the WeisMind website. WeisMind Creative is the parent brand that I use 
to organize my various products and services under one unique umbrella. 

[You can learn more about WeisMind by visiting my digital garden for now](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev).
I am currently developing the WeisMind Website, so most of the information you can find will be on 
that website.

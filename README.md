# WeisGear Outdoor Adventure Co. - Ecommerce Store/Marketplace

The ecommerce store for WeisGear, an authentic outdoor gear and sporting equipment online store. We search far and wide for products. From dumptsters to thrift stores to Ebay - we leave no stone unturned in our emphatic search for affordable equpiment with a story to tell. We strive to be the most authentic outdoor apparel destination on the world wide web and grow a rad community of outdoor enthusiasts who love sharing their adventures with like-minded freedom seekers who care more about the experience than having the most authentic gear.

I've noticed that REI has become much more commercialized over the year and it has made me frustrated and sad. REI got rid of their garage sales and has strayed from the original purpose of their co-op. Their main focus now seems to be on making as much money as they can. While it makes me really sad (I did a huge marketing project on REI in college), I see an opportunity for a truly authentic business that cares more about recycling used gear, offering affordable alternatives, and putting gear in the hands of people who just want to go get lost in nature.

This store is a work in progress and is not ready for production. Check back soon!

## WeisMind Creative Family

WeisGear is a part of the WeisMind Creative family of brands that I have created. WeisMind is my personal brand that I have used since 2016 in various projects and businesses, like WeisMind Consulting and the WeisMind Podcast. I am renewing my efforts at bringing my brand back to life by launching the WeisMind Weekly Newsletter and the WeisMind website. WeisMind Creative is the parent brand that I use to organize my various products and services under one unique umbrella. 

[You can learn more about WeisMind by visiting my digital garden for now](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev). I am currently developing the WeisMind Website, so most of the information you can find will be on that website.
